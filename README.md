# package-query-test
This project's purpose is to create a set of functional tests for archlinuxfr's [package-query](https://github.com/archlinuxfr/package-query) utility.

The tests are running package-query with all options/keys supported and checking its output - whether it complies with the pre-defined patterns (usually, regexps are used).
